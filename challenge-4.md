# Ruby Code Golf Night - Challenge #4

For the `dict/a` file:

1. For all words containing a v and z, print the part of the word until the first z.
2. If there are multiple words where you would print the same word fragment, do not print the word fragment.

The contents of `dict/a` will be provided as the standard input to the program:

```ruby
ruby 4.rb < dict/a
```

The correct answer should be:

```
activiz
adverbializ
alveloz
arsonvaliz
arz
aveloz
aviz
```

Hint: stdlib may be helpful.
